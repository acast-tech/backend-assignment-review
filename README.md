# Recruitment Backend Assignment: Code Review

## Premise

A big part of being part of the development team at Acast is giving feedback to your fellow team members. We need your help to review the code that an other team member has written. The code works in practice, but the solution is questionable and there are many issues and inconsistencies.

The API will be used by Acast to probe all external content. It is expected to be for limited internal use only in the beginning, but will need to grow as it will be exposed for integration with several publishers going forward.

Prepare some notes for a code review together with your team.

## Interview and assessment

During the interview, we want to hear your thoughts about the code. Treat it as if you were reviewing code submitted by a team member or colleague.

Our goal with this task is to create a discussion around the submitted code. We are not trying to trick you or expect you to find any particular issue.

If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to bring them up at any time before or during the interview.
